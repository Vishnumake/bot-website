                <p class="text-light">Just a short drive from the vibrant city of Madurai, there rises a majestic rock
                    hill that resembles the
                    silhouette of a resting elephant. Locals call it Yaanaimalai, meaning “Elephant Hill” in Tamil. But
                    beyond
                    its unique shape lies a deeper mystery — an ancient past carved into stone, echoing stories of
                    faith, art,
                    and civilization that have quietly endured the test of time.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Yaanaimalai isn’t just a geological wonder; it’s a spiritual and historical landmark. This hill
                        is home to ancient Jain sculptures and inscriptions, dating back to 2nd century BCE to 9th
                        century CE. Carved into the rock face are serene Jain Tirthankaras, depicted in meditative
                        postures, surrounded by delicate etchings of Tamil-Brahmi and Vatteluttu inscriptions.</li><br>
                    <li>Each sculpture here is more than just stone — it is a silent storyteller of an era when Jainism
                        flourished in the Tamil region. The hill stands as a testimony to a peaceful, knowledge-driven
                        faith that shaped the region’s cultural and moral fabric long before temples and kings took the
                        stage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For back sleepers, medium-firm mattresses with lumbar support are ideal. A mattress like Nimmathi
                    Anandha or Nimmathi Inimai Pocketed can offer the right support for your spine and enhance comfort
                    during sleep.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Apart from Jain heritage, Yaanaimalai is also home to the Lordanayagi Amman Temple and the Yoga Narasimha Perumal Temple, which sit close to the base of the hill. These temples are still actively worshipped, linking the hill’s ancient past with its spiritual present.</li><br>
                    <li>It is this coexistence of Jain, Vaishnavite, and local folk traditions that makes Yaanaimalai so unique — a living museum where time doesn’t separate, but unites.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Whether you’re a history enthusiast, a photographer, a trekker, or a spiritual seeker, Yaanaimalai offers something that touches the soul. The rock-cut sculptures, the serene surroundings, and the panoramic views from the top of the hill make it a perfect spot for quiet reflection and exploration.</li><br>
                    <li>The surrounding landscape is dotted with shrubs, flowering trees, and occasionally, peacocks and monkeys, giving the place a wild, untouched charm. As you walk along the paths, the sound of the wind brushing across the stone feels almost like ancient whispers — echoes of monks who once meditated here.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-warning">Getting There</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>  Yaanaimalai is located about 10 km northeast of Madurai city, near Othakadai. It’s easily reachable by car, auto, or local buses. Early morning or late evening is the best time to visit, especially for photography and comfortable trekking.</li><br>
